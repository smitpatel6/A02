# Part 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.
1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students and apply for an account. After clicking the "Apply now" button, apply with "Official document" to complete the application.

2. Once your application is processed (which can take a couple of days), you will be able to proceed and download Webstorm from JetBrains.
3. Get git on your computer. To do this, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and click on the download corresponding to your OS. Then follow the steps.
4. Set up a GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/join and create an account using your NJIT email.
5. Connect Webstorm to Git. Open up Webstorm and in settings > Git, provide the Git executable file if it is not already set.
6. Connect Webstorm to your GitHub account. In Webstorm, open system preferences and provide your GitHub password.
7. Create a Repository. In your GitHub account, navigate to Repositories and create a new one, make sure it is public and with a README.md file.
8. Connect Webstorm to your new Repository. When you open Webstorm, select VCS and paste in the URL for your repository. This will import your GitHub repository as well as provide version control (through git).
9. Congratulations! You have now set up Git, Webstorm, and GitHub.
   
# Part 2: Glossary
- **Branch** - takes a copy of the current state of the repository and branches away (parallel) to work on files in the project without messing with the "main" repository branch.
- **Clone** - a copy of the repository that is on your computer.  
- **Commit** - saving changes made to a file or set of files.
- **Fetch** - fetches changes from the remote repository to your local branch without saving them (committing them). 
- **GIT** - a version control system (VCS) that keeps track of all sorts of changes made to a project.
- **GitHub** - an online platform that manages development using Git. 
- **Merge** - combines the changes from one branch into another branch.
- **Merge Conflict** - when there is an issue performing a merge - usually occurs when more than one developer is performing a merge on the same file that has modifications in the same part.
- **Push** - sends the committed files in the branch to the remote repository.
- **Pull** - fetching and merging the changes from the remote repository to your branch (notice how "fetch" only fetches whereas "pull" does both "fetch" and "merge").
- **Remote** - the version of the project that is live on GitHub.com.
- **Repository** - the storage for a project (holds the content of a project).
